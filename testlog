This is a test log. 
Created R01.
Will push and create a pull req to put it into master also.

After merging on the repo came to local directory.
Checkout to master.
The file was not there.
Did a git pull. File came.

Added some code to the file and did git add, git commit and git push origin to master.

Checked out to R01.
The file DOES NOT have the code that was added in the master.

So the code is in Master version but not in R01 version.
Good opportunity to edit the R01 version and see the conflict.

11/6/17 - Added this line
